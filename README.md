====================================================================================

This is a fully-functional PHP form processing application.

1) Requirements
----------------------------------

When it comes to installing you have to first install the WAMP server and to activate the mysqli extension to work with the database. 
Then you have to integrate the files from this archive: copy and paste them on the server's document root.

2) Browsing the Demo Application

Congratulations! You're now ready to use the application.

By accessing this path 

    http://localhost/path-to-project
    or 
    http://localhost/path-to-project/index.php

you will see the form.
You can now test it.

Enjoy!
